interfits
=========

Interfits is a python package for conversion of radio interfeometric data between different formats. It can read
both UVFITS and FITS-IDI files, and can export data tables in JSON format or in FITS-IDI.

Additionally, the LedaFits class reads the raw file formats used in the LEDA project (http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/LEDA/),
and contains methods for combining and computing required metadata.
