DOCUMENTATION
	The documentation for interfits consists primarily of python docstrings
	in the interfits modules themselves.  However, a sphinx-based documentation
	system has been included.  sphinx extracts the docstrings from the
	installed interfits package and builds a variety of manual formats, including
	HTML and PDF.

	To build the documentation sphnix needs to be installed on your system
	To list all avaliable documentation styles, run:
		'make'

	To build the HTML documentation, run:
		'make html'
	This command create a complete set of HTML files in the build/html 
	directory.
